# Ready lots

[Back to the backlog](README.md)

Lots written up and ready to take.

### [FIX-SPAWN-DATA-LOAD-ORDER](FIX-SPAWN-DATA-LOAD-ORDER/PRD.md) · ⬜

A campaign draws its garrisons while `veaf-config.lua` runs, but the groups database loaded from a last trigger, after it: every garrison came out without its air defence (no SA-10 at Senaki). The spawn data loads with the framework instead, as the last action of its load triggers.

### [ENRICH-DEFAULT-PRESETS](ENRICH-DEFAULT-PRESETS/PRD.md) · ⬜

Broaden the shipped default radio presets, after phase 1 of the radio preset projection.

### [FEAT-LIVE-GAME-MASTER](FEAT-LIVE-GAME-MASTER/PRD.md) · ⬜

Claude acting in a running mission while the squadron flies — spawn, destroy, move convoys, radio messages — through the bridge, with an operator token and never raw Lua. Written up 2026-10-08 and decided by David: free by default, nothing shown when Claude plays red, text and SRS voice when it warns blue players; seven tickets, one of them in the bridge's repository.
