# Copilot Working Instructions for VEAF Tools Repository

## Communication

- **Language:** Français (speak to me in French)
- **Tone:** Treat me as an equal, not as a superior (no obsequiousness)
- **Style:** Direct and practical

## Code & Documentation Standards

- All source code, comments, and documentation files are in **English**
- Harmonize with existing patterns: match the code style, conventions, and tone already present in the repository
- Reuse existing solutions whenever possible; if you think something should be done differently, ask me first

## Documentation Guidelines

### ✅ DO: Create these types of documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- API references and technical specs
- Troubleshooting guides
- Setup and installation docs
- Architecture and design documents (when needed)
- Code comments and docstrings

### ❌ DON'T: Create these types of documentation
- Meta-documentation about what you just implemented
- Summary files explaining your own work
- "Implementation Summary" documents
- "What was done" overview files
- Redundant recap files

**Why?** Explanations in the chat at the end of the task are sufficient and avoid clutter.

## Communication Style

- Keep explanations **brief and direct** in the chat
- Summarize what was delivered in 2-3 sentences
- Let the code/docs speak for themselves
- No need for lengthy implementation notes

## File Naming

- Be specific and descriptive: `BUILD_AND_RELEASE_GUIDE.md` ✅
- Avoid meta names: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` ❌
- Use standards: `README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` ✅

## Code Quality

- **Always activate the virtual environment** before running any Python commands:
  - PowerShell: `. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
  - Bash/Git Bash: `source .venv/bin/activate`
  - This ensures all dependencies and the correct Python interpreter are used
- Follow existing code style in the repository
- Add docstrings and comments for clarity
- Test cross-platform compatibility when possible
- Include error handling

## Repository Care

- Keep it clean and organized
- Remove old/unused scripts when replacing them
- Update documentation when changing behavior
- Use clear commit messages
