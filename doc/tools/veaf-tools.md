## Introduction

This nodeJS application is a collection of tools that can be used to manipulate missions.

At the moment, it contains the following tools:
- Weather injector
- mission selector

## Usecase

We, the VEAF, use these tools along with some server hook lua scripts and powershell process watchdogs (all available on [this GitHub repository][VEAF public servers repository]) to have our servers running 24/7, and restarting automatically if they crash.

Every two hours, if no one is connected (or when the last player disconnects), the server will restart.

The startup script will call the weather injector tool, which will generate a set of missions for this server, with different weather conditions (including real-world weather at the time).

Then it'll call the mission selector tool, which will select the mission to start depending on the time of the day and the schedule:

This ensures that our servers are always up, and set up with the mission we collectively decided to load for that time.

### Weather injector

The Weather injector is a tool that transforms a single mission file into a collection of missions, with the same content but different weather and starting conditions.

It can be used to inject a predefined DCS weather definition, read a METAR and generate a mission with the corresponding weather, or even use real-world weather.

It can also create different starting time and dates for the mission, either with absolute values (e.g. 26/01/2023 at 14:20), or with predefined "moments" (e.g. 2 hours after sunset).

This is a very useful tool to use with a server that runs 24/7 and that needs to have different weather conditions for time it starts the same mission.

### Mission selector

The mission selector is used to start a dedicated server with a specific mission, depending on a schedule that is defined in a configuration file.


## Installation

This is an autonomous tool, it does not need a specific VEAF Mission Creation Tools environment (as described [here](..\environment\index.md)).

It's therefore very easy to install on a server, or on your own computer.

***Nota bene: this chapter is also available as a [tutorial video][install-chocolatey-nodejs-veaftools]***

You'll need to install these tools on your computer:

- *nodeJS*: you need NodeJS to run the javascript programs in the VEAF mission creation tools; see [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- *yarn*: you need the Yarn package manager to fetch and update the VEAF mission creation tools; see [here](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Install the tools using Chocolatey

The required tools can easily be installed using *Chocolatey* (see [here](https://chocolatey.org/)).

To install Chocolatey, use this command  in an elevated (admin) Powershell prompt:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

After *Chocolatey* is installed, install NodeJS by typing this simple command in a command prompt:

```cmd
choco install -y nodejs
```

Then close and reopen the command prompt.

### Install the veaf-tools application

In a command prompt type:

```cmd
npm install -g veaf-mission-creation-tools
```

Then close and reopen the command prompt.

## General usage of the application

To run the VEAF tools, simply type `veaf-tools` in a command prompt.

## Updating the application

To update the VEAF tools, simply do the same as for installation.

In a command prompt type:

```cmd
npm install -g veaf-mission-creation-tools
```

NPM will fetch and install the latest version automatically.
