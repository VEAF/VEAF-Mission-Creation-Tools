# [![VEAF-logo]][VEAF website] Mission Creation Tools - Documentation

## Introduction

The VEAF Mission Creation Tools provide tools and scripts designed to easily create, share and maintain dynamic missions.

They contain:

* the VEAF mission scripts (organized in modules)
* the VEAF server hooks
* some of the community scripts, sometimes edited by VEAF (e.g. CTLD, MiST)
* an easy mission creation, edition and publication workflow
* tools to support this workflow, including a converter that build a dynamic mission from an existing static one
* this documentation

Here are a few Github repositories that you should browse:
- main repository: https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Mission-Creation-Tools
- use this to inject the scripts an tools into an existing mission: https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-mission-converter
- demo mission: https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Demo-Mission
- a good working example of the scripts at work: https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Open-Training-Mission

## How do I use the tools in a mission I want to design?

Please have a look at the [Misson Maker documentation](./mission-maker/index.md).

For those looking for a quick start, fork or download the [mission converter](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-mission-converter) and read the `readme.md` file to learn how you can use the VEAF Mission Creation Tools in your own existing mission.

You can also fork or download the [demo mission](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Demo-Mission) to see what can be done (usually only the latest features are demonstrated here), and the [VEAF Caucasus training mission](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Open-Training-Mission) which is a very complex, open and dynamic training mission that uses a lot of the features.

## How do I contribute to this wonderful repository?

First, thank you!

We always welcome help, and new ideas.

Please always use branches and pull requests! Start with forking the VEAF-Mission-Creation-Tools [repository](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Mission-Creation-Tools), create a branch, hack away and publish your work.

## I want to help maintain the documentation!

The easiest way of doing this is by editing the files directly on the Github website.

But you can also fork the repository (see above).

## I need to add new features or correct bugs in the scripts!

[Here](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Mission-Creation-Tools/blob/master/documentation/Mission%20programmer/index.md) is the programmer documentation.
