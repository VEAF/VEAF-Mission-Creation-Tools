# [![VEAF-logo]][VEAF website] Mission Creation Tools - Documentation

# /!\ **WORK IN PROGRESS** /!\
The documentation is being reworked, piece by piece. 
In the meantime, you can browse the [old documentation](../old_documentation/_index.md).

## Introduction

The VEAF Mission Creation Tools provide tools and scripts designed to easily create, share and maintain dynamic missions.

They regroup:

* the VEAF mission scripts (organized in modules)
* the VEAF server hooks
* some of the community scripts, sometimes edited by VEAF (e.g. CTLD, MiST)
* an easy mission creation, edition and publication workflow
* tools to support this workflow, including a converter that build a dynamic mission from an existing static one
* this documentation

Our Github repositories:

* the [main][VEAF-Mission-Creation-Tools-repository] repository contains all the sources and the documentation base
* the [mission converter][VEAF-mission-converter-repository] can be forked or downloaded to inject the scripts and tools into an existing mission
* the [demo mission][VEAF-demo-mission-repository] (again, fork or download) is a small, simple mission that uses some of the latest features of the tools
* the VEAF [Caucasus training mission][VEAF-Open-Training-Mission-repository] (fork or download) is a good working example of the scripts in a complex mission
* the VEAF [multiplayer missions repository][VEAF-Multiplayer-Missions-repository] contains mission that we played with the VEAF (some may be old and deprecated!)

## What do I need to start?

You'll need to setup an environment, on your PC, with specific (free) software.

[These instructions](./environment/index.md) are for Windows 10, no support is given for Linux or MacOS.
## How do I use the tools in a mission I want to design?

Please read the [Misson Maker documentation](./mission-maker/index.md).

For those looking for a quick start, fork or download the [mission converter](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-mission-converter) and follow the instructions of the `readme.md` file. You'll learn how to can use the VEAF Mission Creation Tools in your own existing mission.

You can also fork or download the [demo mission](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Demo-Mission) to see what can be done (usually only the latest features are demonstrated here), and the [VEAF Caucasus training mission](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Open-Training-Mission) which is a very complex, open and dynamic training mission that uses a lot of the features.

## How do I contribute to this wonderful repository?

First, thank you!

We always welcome help, and new ideas.

Please always use branches and pull requests! Start with forking the VEAF-Mission-Creation-Tools [repository](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Mission-Creation-Tools), create a branch, hack away and publish your work.

## I want to help maintain the documentation!

The easiest way of doing this is by editing the files directly on the Github website.
