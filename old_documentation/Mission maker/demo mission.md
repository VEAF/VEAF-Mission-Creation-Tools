## Introduction

The demo mission is a project in the [VEAF GitHub repository](https://github.com/VEAF) that can be forked to serve as the basis of a new mission using the VEAF Mission Creation Tools.
It does not include all the features of the tools; for a more in-depth example, you can check the *[VEAF-Open-Training-Mission](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Open-Training-Mission)* repository.

## How to set up a mission

Start by forking or cloning the *[VEAF-Demo-Mission](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Demo-Mission)* repository.
You can then use the files you cloned as an example, or use your fork to create a new mission.

The missions in the [VEAF GitHub repository](https://github.com/VEAF) have all been created with this method.

## Set up your shop

To set up the mission builder workshop, please refer to [this explanation](../../#workflow)

## Make your mission

Simply use the DCS mission editor to edit your mission.

Refer to [the modules specific documentation](../modules/) for more information on how to configure and use each specific feature.

Also, you can refer to [this explanation](../#how-to-set-up-a-mission) for a detailed insight on how the demo mission is set up.
