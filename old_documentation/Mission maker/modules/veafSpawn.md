## Introduction

This module allows the user to spawn several type of DCS objects in a running mission ; it can spawn :

* groups that have been defined with the veafUnits module
* units that are defined in DCS (either via their veafUnits alias, or their DCS type name
* dynamic groups that use templates defined with the veafUnits module, but can be configured and are randomized
* convoys that can go from a point to another, and be tracked and managed with radio commands
* cargo statics and logistic points that are registered with [CTLD](https://github.com/ciribob/DCS-CTLD) and can be transported via helicopter
* bombs that can destroy scenery, units and groups (even client aircrafts and vehicles)
* smoke and illumination flares

It also provides commands to :

* teleport an existing unit or group to a different location
* cleanly destroy a unit or several units inside a defined circle (without leaving a smoking wreck behind, that is)

## How to set up a mission

Let's start by saying that you can clone the *[VEAF-Demo-Mission](https://github.com/VEAF/VEAF-Demo-Mission)* repository and use it as an example (or fork it and create a new mission from your fork).

### Load the script and its prerequisites

In DCS mission editor, set up a "mission start" trigger that will :

* load the following scripts (in order) :
  * mist.lua (from the *community* folder)
  * veaf.lua
  * veafUnits.lua
  * veafMarkers.lua
  * veafRadio.lua
  * veafCasMission.lua
  * veafSpawn.lua
* run the following lua code :

  ```lua
  veafUnits.initialize();
  veafMarkers.initialize();
  veafRadio.initialize();
  veafCasMission.initialize();
  veafSpawn.initialize();
  ```

## How to use in a mission

### Markers

The veafSpawn module is managed by creating markers, which names should follow a specific syntax (see next headings).

This syntax is composed of a mandatory instruction (at the beginning) and mandatory or optional (depending on the instruction) parameters separated by commas.

Example : ``_spawn group, name US infgroup, country USA``

For more informations about markers, see [Markers](../concepts/usermarks.md)

### Spawn units and groups

The **_spawn** instruction can spawn units (``_spawn unit``) or groups (``_spawn groups``).

Both commands accept the same set of mandatory (bold) or optional (italic) parameters:

* **name** is the name of the unit or group in the VEAF and DCS databases; The *HELP - all units* and *HELP - all groups* radio menu commands will list all valid values; e.g. ``_spawn unit, name sa6``
* *country* (default *RUSSIA*) is the name of the country this unit will belong to; e.g. ``_spawn group, name US infgroup, country USA``
* *speed* (default *0*) is the speed of the unit/group, when it spawns. For most units/groups it will reset to its predefined orders; e.g. ``_spawn unit, name sa6, speed 15``
* *altitude* or *alt* (default *0*) is the altitude of the unit/group (same remarks as _speed_); e.g. ``_spawn unit, name sa6, alt 15``
* *heading* or *hdg* (default *0*) is the heading of the unit/group (same remarks as _speed_); e.g. ``_spawn unit, name sa6, hdg 270``

Some parameters are specific to the ``_spawn unit`` instruction:

* *unitName* (default is the unit display name in DCS suffixed with a numeric counter) will be the name this unit will have in the DCS mission (not to be mistaken with the unit type parameter, **name**); e.g. ``_spawn unit, name sa6, unitname air-defense-SA6``

A special instruction will spawn a specific unit with a JTAC role, and set it as invisible and invincible: **_spawn jtac**.

It has a specific parameter:

* *laser* (default *1688*) can be used to choose a laser code for the JTAC ; e.g. ``_spawn jtac, laser 1681``

Some parameters are specific to the ``_spawn group`` instruction:

* *spacing* (default *5*) is used to add space between a group's units (see [veafUnits](./veafUnits.md))
* *isconvoy* (default *false*) if set, makes the group behave like a convoy

  * **dest** (mandatory in this case) the named point where the convoy must go (see [veafNamedPoints](./veafnamedpoints.md))
  * *patrol* (default *false*) if set, makes the group go back and forth between its spawn point and its destination point
  * *offroad* (default *false*) if set, the group will not try and use roads

Examples:

``_spawn unit, name sa6, unitname tbilissi-air-defense country UKRAINE, hdg 245``

``_spawn group, name RU-SAM-SA9-Battery, spacing 10``

``_spawn group, name US infgroup, isconvoy, dest TBILISSI, speed 15, patrol``

### Spawn dynamic groups

The **_spawn** instruction can also spawn dynamic groups; these groups are randomized, and parameters can be used to choose several aspects of this randomization.

This is the list of the parameters common to all the dynamic group spawn instructions:

* *side* (default *RED*) is the coalition the group(s) will belong to (RED or BLUE)
* *country* (default *USA* for side=blue, *RUSSIA* for side=red) is the country the group(s) will belong to
* *heading* (default *0*) is the global heading of the groups; units in the group will have their individual heading (in the template definition) adapted to be relative to this global heading
* *spacing* (default *5*) is used to add space between a group's units (see [veafUnits](./veafUnits.md)), but also to add space between the groups

The type of the dynamic group is linked to the instruction itself. Each dynamic group instruction has its own set of parameter.

#### infantry section

``_spawn infantrygroup`` will spawn an infantry section (an armored personnel carrier with an infantry section and optional air defense - manpads)

* *defense* (default *1*) will determine the air defense generated for this group:
  * if 0: no manpad
  * 1..3: between 1 and *defense* older manpad systems
  * 4..5: between 1 and *defense*-2 modern manpad systems
* *armor* (default *1*) will determine the personnel carrier vehicle:
  * if 0: a M 818 (BLUE) or a GAZ-3308 (RED) truck
  * 1..3: a IFV Boman (BLUE) or a BTR-80 (RED)
  * 4..5: a M-2 Bradley (BLUE) or a BMP-1 (RED)

#### armor platoon

``_spawn armorgroup`` will spawn an armor platoon (3-6 armored vehicles with optional escorting air defence systems)

* *defense* (default *1*) will determine the air defense generated for this group:
  * if 0: no air defense
  * 1..3: a Gepard (BLUE) or a ZSU-23-4 Shilka (RED)
  * 4..5: an M6 Linebacker (BLUE) or a 2S6 Tunguska (RED)
* *armor* (default *1*) will determine the personnel carrier vehicle:
  * 0..2: random choice between M-2 Bradley, IFV MCV-80, IFV Boman (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMD-1, BRDM-2 (RED)
  * 3: random choice between M-2 Bradley (66%), M-60 (33%) (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMP-2, T-55 (RED)
  * 4: random choice between M-2 Bradley (50%), M-60 (25%), Leopard-2 (25%) (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMP-2, T-55, T-72 (RED)
  * 5: random choice between M-2 Bradley (50%), MBT Leopard1A3 (25%), M-1 Abrams (25%) (BLUE) or BMP-2, BMP-3, T-80UD, T-90 (RED)

#### air defense battery

``_spawn samgroup`` will spawn an air defense battery (multiple air defense launchers/systems, a search radar and support vehicles)

* *defense* the group will be spawned from the *veafUnit* template called "generateAirDefenseGroup-*side*-*defense*" where *side* is either RED or BLUE and *defense* is the *defense* parameter value; e.g. *generateAirDefenseGroup-RED-3*

#### transport company

``_spawn transportgroup`` will spawn a transport company (several trucks with optional escorting air defence systems)

* *defense* (default *1*) will determine the air defense generated for this group, one of these air defense system for every ten trucks:
  * if 0: no air defense
  * 1: a Gepard (BLUE) or a Ural-375 ZU-23 (RED)
  * 2: a Gepard (BLUE) or a ZSU-23-4 Shilka (RED)
  * 3: an M6 Linebacker (BLUE) or a 2S6 Tunguska (RED)
  * 4..5: an M6 Linebacker and a Gepard (BLUE) or a 2S6 Tunguska and a ZSU-23-4 Shilka (RED)
* *size* (default *10*) the number of trucks that will be spawned

#### full combat group

``_spawn combatgroup`` will spawn a full combat group, composed of multiple infantry groups, multiple armor platoons, several transport companies and 1 or 2 air defense groups

* *defense* (default *1*) will be used for every generated group (see above)
* *armor* (default *1*) will be used for every generated group (see above)
* *size* (default *10*) will be used for every generated group (see above) and condition the groups that will be generated:
  * between *size*-2 and *size*+1 infantry groups
  * between *size*-2 and *size*+1 armor platoons
  * 1 or 2 air defense groups if *defense* is not 0
  * between 1 and *size* transport companies

Examples:

``_spawn samgroup, defense 3, side blue``

``_spawn armorgroup, defense 0, armor 5, side red``

``_spawn combatgroup, defense 1, armor 2, size 5, side blue``

### Spawn convoys

The ``_spawn convoy`` instruction will generate a dynamic convoy, and send it on its route to a named point (see [veafNamedPoints](./veafnamedpoints.md)).

The convoys are tracked and managed in the VEAF SPAWN radio menu.

It is possible to find out if a convoy still exists (or was destroyed entirely), find out where it is (or between which points it travels) thanks to smoke markers, or dispose of a convoy.

The convoy will be composed of a transport company (see [transport company](#transport-company) above) and an armor platoon (see [armor platoon](#armor-platoon) above).

This instruction accepts several parameters:

* **destination** or **dest** is the name of a [named point](./veafnamedpoints.md) where the convoy will drive to
* *offroad* (default *false*) if set, the convoy will not try and use roads
* *size* (default *10*) the number of trucks that will be spawned; no transport company at all if 0
* *armor* (default *1*) will determine the personnel carrier vehicle:
  * 0: no armor platoon
  * 1..2: random choice between M-2 Bradley, IFV MCV-80, IFV Boman (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMD-1, BRDM-2 (RED)
  * 3: random choice between M-2 Bradley (66%), M-60 (33%) (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMP-2, T-55 (RED)
  * 4: random choice between M-2 Bradley (50%), M-60 (25%), Leopard-2 (25%) (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMP-2, T-55, T-72 (RED)
  * 5: random choice between M-2 Bradley (50%), MBT Leopard1A3 (25%), M-1 Abrams (25%) (BLUE) or BMP-2, BMP-3, T-80UD, T-90 (RED)

The players can use the following radio menu commands:

* *Info on all convoys* will output a list of convoys; for each convoy it'll print its name, the number of remaining vehicles, and its position
* *Mark closest convoy route* will pop a green smoke at the convoy's starting point, and a red one at the end point
* *Mark closest convoy* will pop a white smoke at the convoy's current position
* *Cleanup all convoys* will remove all active convoys from the mission

### Spawn cargo statics and logistic points

These are specific to [CTLD](https://github.com/ciribob/DCS-CTLD) and, for it to work, it has to be configured in your mission.

You can follow [these instructions](../third-party/ctld.md) to configure CTLD in your mission.

#### cargo statics

Cargo statics (crates, ammo, fuel barrels and the like) can be spawned by the ``_spawn cargo`` instruction

This instruction accepts these parameters:

* *name* (default *ammo_cargo*) is the type of cargo to be spawned. It must be a valid cargo known by DCS and transportable. The *HELP - all cargoes* radio menu command will list all valid values; e.g. ``_spawn cargo, name barrels_cargo``
* *smoke* if set, will pop a green smoke where the cargo is spawned; e.g. ``_spawn cargo, smoke``
* *unitName* (default is the cargo display name in DCS suffixed with a numeric counter) will be the name this cargo will have in the DCS mission (not to be mistaken with the unit type parameter, **name**); e.g. ``_spawn cargo, name barrels_cargo, unitname and-two-barrels-of-rhum``

Cargo spawned is registered with CTLD and transportable by whatever aircraft CTLD is configured to accept as a transport aircraft.

#### logistic points

Logistic points are static DCS units that marks the center of a CTLD logistic zone.

When spawned with the ``_spawn logistic`` instruction, they are registered with CTLD and when inside their action radius, aircraft configured in CTLD as transport aircrafts can load troops and spawn deployable crates with CTLD.

This instruction does not accept any parameter.

### Spawn bombs and artillery shelling

The ``_spawn bomb`` instruction will create and detonate a bomb at the specified location. The bomb detonation will destroy or damage the surrounding units, statics and world objects.

This instruction accepts this parameter:

* *power* (default *100*) is the bomb detonation power (limited to 1000)

**NB:** artillery shelling is not yet available.

### Spawn smoke markers and illumination flares

#### smoke marker

Smoke markers of multiple colors can be spawned by the players with the ``_spawn smoke`` instruction

This instruction accepts this parameter:

* *color* (default *red*) is the color of the spawned smoke marker (possible values are red, green, orange, blue and white); e.g. ``_spawn smoke, color orange``

#### illumination flares

Illumination flares will light up a zone when the night is too dark to see the targets; they can be spawned with the ``_spawn flare`` instruction

This instruction accepts this parameter:

* *altitude* or *alt* (default *1000*) is the altitude (in meters) at which the flare will begin its descent; e.g. ``_spawn flare, alt 2000``

### Teleport objects

The **_teleport** instruction can instantly move units or groups.

This instruction accepts this mandatory parameter:

* **name** is the name of the DCS group that will be moved; e.g. ``_teleport, name Arco``

### Destroy objects

The **_destroy** instruction can instantly destroy units inside a radius around the chose point.

The destroyed objects do not leave any wreck and are simply removed from the mission.

This instruction accepts this parameter:

* *radius* (default *150*) is the destruction radius (in meters); e.g. ``_destroy, radius 500``
