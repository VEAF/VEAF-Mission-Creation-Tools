# VEAF Waypoints Configuration Example
# This file defines waypoints and flight plan settings for DCS missions
#
# STRUCTURE:
# 1. waypoints: Define individual waypoints (position, altitude, speed, etc.)
# 2. settings: Define flight plan templates that use those waypoints

# Define individual waypoints
# These are the building blocks that will be assembled into flight plans
waypoints:
  # Example waypoint 1: Bullseye (turning point)
  BULLSEYE:
    type: "Turning Point"
    action: "Turning Point"
    alt: 6096          # 20000 ft in meters
    alt_type: "BARO"
    speed: 999
    speed_type: "TAS"
    x: 75869
    y: 48674
    name: "BULLSEYE"
    ETA: 364.89
    ETA_locked: false

  # Example waypoint 2: Initial Point
  INITIAL_POINT:
    type: "Turning Point"
    action: "Turning Point"
    alt: 3048          # 10000 ft
    alt_type: "BARO"
    speed: 50
    speed_type: "TAS"
    x: 70000
    y: 50000
    name: "INITIAL_POINT"

  # Example waypoint 3: Target
  TARGET:
    type: "Turning Point"
    action: "Fly Over Ground"
    alt: 1524          # 5000 ft
    alt_type: "BARO"
    speed: 100
    speed_type: "TAS"
    x: 75000
    y: 48000
    name: "TARGET"

# Define flight plan settings
# These determine which waypoints are injected into which aircraft groups
# Matching criteria (all optional): category, coalition, type, country
# If no criteria are specified, the plan applies to all groups
settings:
  # Flight plan for all blue planes
  all_blue_planes:
    category: "plane"
    coalition: "blue"
    # No type or country specified - applies to all blue planes
    waypoints:
      BULLSEYE: "BULLSEYE"
      INITIAL_POINT: "INITIAL_POINT"

  # Flight plan for all red helicopters
  all_red_helicopters:
    category: "helicopter"
    coalition: "red"
    waypoints:
      BULLSEYE: "BULLSEYE"

  # Flight plan for specific aircraft type
  f16_flight_plan:
    category: "plane"
    coalition: "blue"
    type: "F-16C_50"
    # Only F-16C aircraft will receive this plan
    waypoints:
      INITIAL_POINT: "INITIAL_POINT"
      TARGET: "TARGET"
      BULLSEYE: "BULLSEYE"

  # Flight plan for all aircraft (acts as default)
  default_plan:
    # No category, coalition, or type specified
    # Only used if no other plans match
    waypoints:
      BULLSEYE: "BULLSEYE"

# USAGE NOTES:
#
# 1. Matching Priority:
#    - Aircraft type (type field) is checked first
#    - Then category (plane/helicopter)
#    - Then coalition (blue/red)
#    - Finally, plans with no criteria match all
#
# 2. Targeting:
#    - Only human-piloted aircraft groups receive waypoints
#    - Leave a setting with no criteria as a fallback for all units
#
# 3. Coordinates:
#    - X and Y are in mission coordinates (not lat/lon)
#    - Altitude (alt) is in meters
#    - Speed is in m/s
#
# 4. Waypoint Order:
#    - Waypoints are injected in the order they appear in the settings
#    - The first waypoint becomes the initial waypoint
#
# 5. Fields:
#    - type: "Turning Point", "TakeOffGround", "TakeOff", "Landing", etc.
#    - action: Usually same as type
#    - alt_type: "BARO" (barometric) or "RADIO" (AGL)
#    - speed_type: "TAS" (true airspeed) or "IAS" (indicated airspeed)
#    - ETA fields are optional
